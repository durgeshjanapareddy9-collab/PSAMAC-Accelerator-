# flow/power.tcl -- power of a synthesized mul_wrap netlist from simulation activity.
#
# Run with OpenSTA (normally from flow/power.py):
#   NETLIST=... LIB=... VCD=... SCOPE=tb_power/dut CLK_NS=10 OUT=... \
#       sta -no_init -exit flow/power.tcl
#
# Method:
#   1. The gate-level netlist was simulated (tb/tb_power.sv) and every net's
#      switching was recorded in a VCD file.
#   2. read_vcd attaches that activity (toggle rate and time-at-1) to every
#      cell pin (the VCD includes cell pins, see tb/tb_power.sv).
#   3. report_power adds up, per cell: internal power (inside the cell),
#      switching power (charging the capacitance it drives) and leakage.
#   Corner: the liberty file in LIB (tt, 25 C, 1.80 V). Pre-layout: no wire
#   capacitance, ideal clock. Zero-delay simulation: glitches are not counted.
